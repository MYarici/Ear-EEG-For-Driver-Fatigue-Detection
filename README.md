Abstract: Ear EEG based driver fatigue monitoring systems have the potential to provide a seamless, efficient, and feasibly deployable alternative to existing scalp EEG based systems, which are often cumbersome and impractical. However, the feasibility of detecting the relevant delta, theta, alpha, and beta band EEG activity through the ear EEG is yet to be investigated. Through measurements of scalp and ear EEG on eleven subjects during a simulated, monotonous driving experiment, this study provides statistical analysis of characteristic ear EEG changes that are associated with the transition from alert to mentally fatigued states, and subsequent testing of a machine learning based automatic fatigue detection system. Novel numerical evidence is provided to support the feasibility of detection of mental fatigue with ear EEG that is in agreement with widely reported scalp EEG findings. This study paves the way for the development of ultra-wearable and readily deployable hearables based driver fatigue monitoring systems. 

Pre-processing: All channels were first bandpass-filtered between \SI{1}{Hz} and \SI{40}{Hz}, using a custom Butterworth filter that was created through the DSP System Toolbox (get filter specs from code, should be easy).
